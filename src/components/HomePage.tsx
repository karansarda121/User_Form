            Better is an AI powered software development agency and builds web,
            mobile, and custom applications with solid engineering foundations.

            Unlike 99% of agency-built software that struggles with poor
            foundations, leading to costly rebuilds and bug-ridden iterations,
            we prioritize creating a rock-solid technical base from the start.
            This ensures smoother scaling and easier future development.

            Over the last 7 years, we've had the privilege of working with
            bootstrapped companies that have gone on to generate over $100M in
            revenue, as well as unicorns and startups backed by Techstars, top
            VCs like Andreessen Horowitz, and executives from industry giants
            like Apple and Google.
